# A regression machine learning model
In this project, I am tasked to model the shortfall between the energy generated by means of fossil fuels and various renewable sources - for the country of Spain. The daily shortfall, which is referred to as the target variable, is modelled as a function of various city-specific weather features such as `pressure`, `wind speed`, `humidity`, etc.
